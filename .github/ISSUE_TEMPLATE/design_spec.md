### General concept of your idea, what purpose does it serve?

Example: We want to use a `Toolbar` component in our design that will allow us to place buttons directly near content in a non intrusive way. It could look something like this: [Your awesome wireframe/mockup/design]. On mobile it could be akin to this [Your awesome mobile wireframe/mockup/design].

### How does this relate to current implementations?

Example: This would allow to us to replace a lot of static forms with a toolbar that provides instant feedback on user behavior.

### Is there anything specific you'd like feedback on/help with?

Example: I'm not sure how buildable the mobile design is in certain situation and would like to know what you think.
