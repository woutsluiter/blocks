# Docs

This website is auto generated from mdx files in this repo. The website currently supports the following features:

- [x] Rendering MDX readme's as react.
- [x] Auto generating pages based on mdx files.

## Running the website

Start by running `yarn` in this folder, this make sure all your dependencies are installed and symlinks the your `../../dist` folder to this website's node_modules.

Currently there are 3 scripts that you can run to get te website up and running. 

- `update-blocks`: builds blocks.
- `update-docs`: generates pages from the mdx documents in `/markdown`. The generated pages can be found in `/pages/generated`.
- `start`: start the next server. The website is then accessable on [http:localhost:3000](http:localhost:3000)

> Note: This site is a work in progress. Feel free to submit a PR improving this experience or leave an issue ✌️.
