# Icons

## Icon style
Wout Sluiter has its own icon set, supporting three different sizes: 

* Large (60x60)
* Regular (18x18)
* Small (12x12)

The icons are all based on minimal line-art and have a consistent border-width within their size-group. The icons should therefore not be resized, as this would create inconsistencies in border-width.
