# Typography
Our typography is based on three categories of usage (Display, Heading and Body) and supports different sizes based on a 3px grid. Some of the categories and sizes have extra options like a light, emphasized or compact version.

## Display
This is the largest size we have. It is used for marketing purposes only. The larger size makes it a real attention grabber.

## Heading
These text-styles are used as headings (h1 - h3), titles (h1 - h2) and subheadings (h3 - h6). Headings are top-level elements of a section. Titles are top level elements of pages and modals. Subheadings are elements below headings to create hierarchy within sections.

## Body
These styles are used for the main text, like paragraphs.
