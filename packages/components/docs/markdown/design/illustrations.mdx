# Illustrations

Within the back office of Wout Sluiter, we use two types of illustrations. One is defined as the "large icon" set, the other comes from undraw.co. When which style is used depends on its purpose.

## Illustrations Undraw.co
For illustrations, we use undraw.co to maintain consistency within the platform. If this site does not provide an adequate illustration, know you can compile it yourself with various elements from other illustrations. Just make sure the balance and style are maintained.

An undraw.co illustration celebrates with the merchants or supports the action that we ask of them. Some promotions have a fixed illustration such as the upgrade modals. Others are chosen based on the context of the page. 

##### When to use undraw.co illustrations
* Marketing and special moment modals
* When an icon doesn’t tell the story 
* When you need an element of joy and playfulness

##### When not to use undraw.co
* When the illustration is overpowering the interface and causes confusion for the merchant. 
* When the illustration isn’t correlating with the tone of voice of the page

#### Principles
##### Illustrations are supportive of the content
Each illustration must reinforce or support the content. They are never just there for decoration, but they are not clickable. Keep the accompanying illustration as simple as possible.

##### Illustrations make contact
Illustrations are used to strengthen our contact with the merchant. Always ask yourself what you want to radiate and what the most important feeling the user is experiencing at that moment. Do you want to reinforce this feeling or clarify it?

##### Illustrations convey diversity
Make sure that our customer base can empathize with the set of illustrations we use. This means a variety of people, both male and female, white and of color.

#### Sizing undraw
Dimensions depend on context and placement. Remember that illustrations are supportive of the content, make sure that this is clear in the hierarchy. Also

## Large icons

##### When to use Large icons
* When you need to increase wayfinding (readability and scanability)
* When you need to visualize challenging concepts

##### When not to use large icons
* When you need to fill some empty space
* When there is an established icon available 
* When there is a specific tone-of-voice you can enhance with an illustration 

#### Principles

##### Improve readability and scanability 
The main goal of a large icon is to improve the readability and scanability of an interface. Therefore, the large icons are based on minimal line-art to keep them simple and informative without too much detail that may distract the merchant. 

##### Place within scope 
A large icon is always placed within a sensible distance of the content they reinforce. Icons should have specific meaning, and be used to relay that meaning.

#### Sizing
Large icons have a standard size of 60x60px and have a consistent border-width within their size-group. The icons should therefore not be resized, as this would create inconsistencies in border-width.

#### Where to use

##### Main menu
Large icons are paired with text in the main navigation to improve the recognization of items. They are displayed in the same color as the text. 

##### Dashboard
Icons are in the same cadre as the data they amplify. This reinforces and improves the scanability of the dashboard. They are lighter in color than the text because they serve as support. 

##### Corporate website
Large icons are also used in the corporate website to attract the eye of the visitor to important features in our platform.

## Empty state
There is only one empty state design. It’s designed using the large icon “Cactus” and varies in size. Empty states tell users that there’s no content to display—and what they can do next.
