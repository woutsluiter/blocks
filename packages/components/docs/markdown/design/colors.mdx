# Colors
#### Usage and guidelines
Color is an important tool in our design system. It is used to guide attention and add meaning. We follow color guidelines to optimize the use of this important tool.

#### Function over form
Picking a color should always be a rational decision. Ensure the color you pick does not only ‘look nice’, always make sure it fits the content and its purpose. 

#### Guide attention
Be aware that color is a big attention grabber. Use this to your advantage to guide the attention where you want it most. Contrasting colors should be used sparingly to help create a clear hierarchy on a page. 

#### Accessible
Even though color is a very important tool, never rely on color alone. Keep in mind that the design should be accessible to people who are color blind or who have low-vision. We encourage a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5.

## Color semantics
Some colors have special meaning, similar to a traffic light. Except that our traffic light has four statuses: 

#### Success
Use Success to emphasize positivity and positive actions. Success uses a darker-1 variant of green to increase contrast and improve legibility. 

#### Warning
Use Warning to communicate important potentially breaking information without immediate danger. Warning uses a darker-1 variant of yellow to increase contrast and improve legibility. 

#### Error
Use Error to communicate important breaking information with immediate danger or destructive actions. Error uses the base variant of red because the brightness makes it stand out a bit more.

#### Neutral
Use Neutral to convey useful additional information. Neutral uses a lighter-2 variant of grey to support page-hierarchy and to differ from our base grey without grabbing too much attention.
