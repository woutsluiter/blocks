# Navigation

## Back-office menu

The main tool to navigate in the MOS back-office. The menu contains all pages of the MOS back-office and is divided in sections. On desktop it is always positioned on the left of the screen and all sections, except for the Dashboard, can be collapsed. 

#### Main level / Sections
The main level of the back-office menu consists of sections. Each section is a subject that can contain multiple pages in its sublevel. All sections are collapsible and do not link to a page directly (with the exception of the dashboard which directly links to the dashboard page).

#### Sublevel / Pages
All sublevel menu-items link directly to a page.  

##### Usage and guidelines
* All sections except the dashboard collapse when clicked on, they do not link to pages 
* All sublevel items link to a page when clicked on
* Menu items are short and concise (preferably 1 word and max. 30 characters)
* The menu is always available (on desktop on the left side)

## Pagination
Pagination divides a large list of items in several pages a user can browse through. It is a way to order or separate a long list that would take too long to load or be too much at once. 

##### Usage and guidelines
* Lists with more than 50 items are broken up into pages if they would otherwise take too long to load or become unclear
* A page can contain upto 50 items
* The first and last page should always be accessible with one click
* The previous and next page should always be accessible with one click
* If there are 6 or more pages the middle pages are hidden behind an ellipsis (...).
* The ellipsis is not clickable
* Pagination is positioned below the pages
* Pages are indicated with numbers

###### Examples

## Breadcrumbs
At the top of each page are breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs show the path you took to get to the page you are at now. In the MOS Back-office the breadcrumbs always start with the Dashboard, followed by the previous/main section and the current page.  

##### Usage and guidelines
* Breadcrumbs show at least two previous levels
* Are clickable and link to the previous pages
* Previous breadcrumbs are underlined
* Are separated by a >
* Are positioned at the top of a page
* End in the current page (not clickable)
