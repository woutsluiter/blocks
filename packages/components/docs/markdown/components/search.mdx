# Search and sort

## Search
The search component is always placed on the right side of the page, in relation to the data you can search through. 

##### Usage and guidelines
When the user starts typing into the search field, the search term is executed immediately.
Thereâ€™s a placeholder text inside the search-input-box to indicate which data can be searched. 
As soon as the user start typing, a clear-input-icon appears in the field to easily remove the search term. 

##### Examples

## Sort

There is a sort functionality available when working with tables. 

##### Usage and Guidelines
The sort functionality can added on any column when working with tables. It sorts the content alphabetically (a-z and z-a or none) or chronologically (numbers).
