## Skeletons
A pre-loading state of a page or element that lets users get used to the general lay-out and indicate that something is loading.

##### Usage and guidelines
* Skeletons are used to display a low fidelity version of the interface before the content is loaded. This improves the way load times are perceived by our merchants. Skeletons give the merchant an indication of what the page will look like when it is fully loaded.

##### Examples
```Image | Text```
