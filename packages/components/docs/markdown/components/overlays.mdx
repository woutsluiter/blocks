## Modals 

##### Usage and guidelines
Modals should be used sparingly as they tend to take over the entire screen. They should only be used when full attention is required or when something important/irreversible is about to happen.

## With illustration 

### Mobile
On mobile, illustrations are placed at the top of the modal. Margins around the illustrations are 24px, except for 36px top-margin. On a small mobile screen (everything below iPhone 8+) the max-height of an illustration is 200px. When the screen is 8+ or larger, the max-height of an illustration is 250px. 
Margins around the content and the button are 18px, but there is a 12px marge between the title and the body to connect those two elements. The close button at the right corner has a 24px padding but does not interfere with the illustration. Just make sure the illustration isn’t in its way! 
The modal itself has a margin of 9px to the edges of the screen. The height of the modal is adjustable to the content, but can never be scrollable. When the illustration is too high for the content to fit, you just have to find another, wider, illustration. 

### Web - small
A small dialog has a width of 480px with the illustration still at the top. Margins around the illustration are 36px, except for 48px top-margin. There is no max height for the illustration, just make sure it doesn’t take up all the space. 
The content has a 36px margin all around but the space between the title and the body text is 24px. The close button at the right top corner has a 36px padding and does not interfere with the illustration. 
Furthermore, the buttons have a 24px marge but are spaced at just 18px apart and are aligned to the right of the modal.

### Web - medium and large
These are the modals where the illustration is placed on the right side of the modal. 
Margins around the illustration are 36px, except for 48px top-margin. There is no max height. 
On a medium modal, the content has a marge of 36px all around and a max-width of 360px. On a large modal, the content is at a max-width of 498px. There is only a 24px between title and body text. The close button at the right top corner has a 36px padding. Furthermore, the buttons have a 24px marge but are spaced at just 18px apart and are aligned to the right of the modal.

### Takeaways
A heigh modal, needs a vertical illustration to balance the design out. If you have a modal with little text, make sure you use a horizontal illustration to balance the modal out.
