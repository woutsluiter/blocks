# Notifications

## Toasters (feedback)
A toaster is a non-disruptive way to display a message to the user. They are always shown at the top of the screen and provide immediate feedback on a user action.

The success- and info toasters will automatically disappear after ±6 seconds. There is no need for the user to interact with these messages. They are dismissible for the really impatient users ;) 

The error- and warning toasters stay visible until the user dismisses them by clicking a button or the close-icon. 

### Parts
A toaster always exists out of these parts: 

#### Severity indicator
The color on the left side of the toaster, indicates the severity of the message. 
Info | Success | Error | Warning

#### Icon
The icon relates to the severity of the toaster. An info toaster will show an “i-icon” where a warning or error toaster will show a triangle-exclamation-mark-icon.

#### Message
The message is defined by a title and/or a description which are both as short, clear and descriptive as possible.

##### Usage and guidelines
* The message must be related to the previous action
* It’s short and confirmative 
* Always shown at the top of the page.

## Notification center (Message stream)

In the back office there is a Notification center where we communicate with the merchant. These are messages regarding new functionalities or important updates. Users are notified by a badge at the bell-icon. 

##### Examples
```Succes | warning | Error | Info```

##### Usage and guidelines
* A notification is shown with the rollout of new or updated functions.

## Inline notifications 
Inline notifications are short, in-context messages that tell the user that something has gone wrong with an entry in a form. Use inline notifications so the user knows why an entry is not possible and how it can be resolved. 

##### Usage and guidelines
* Always includes an icon which helps identify the message for users. (error, info, warning, succes, etc) 
* Inline error should be brief, but clearly explain what went wrong and how you can fix it. 
* Inline-notifications are placed underneath the inputfield of the form, so users don’t have to search for new instructions. 

##### Examples
```Error | warning | Success | Info```
