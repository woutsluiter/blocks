## Filenaming
Filenames should be a good description of the icon itself, not its action in an application. 
For example: an icon of a pencil should be something like `pencil.svg`, not `edit.svg`.

## Exports
Donâ€™t forget to add an export of the icon to `index.ts`. Export name should be PascalCase with Icon as suffix, 
e.g. `arrow-down-circle` becomes `ArrowDownCircleIcon`.
